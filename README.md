# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. The dataset is used to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, sex, class, and other characteristics. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to understand the patterns and relationships within the dataset.

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook** (`EDA_Titanic.ipynb`): Contains the full code for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
- **PDF Report** (`EDA_Titanic_Report.pdf`): A PDF version of the findings, which summarizes the key insights and visualizations.

## Dataset Information
The Titanic dataset contains the following columns:
- **PassengerId**: An identifier for each passenger.
- **Pclass**: The passenger's class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
- **Name**: The name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: The amount the passenger paid for the ticket.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).
- **Survived**: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, converting categorical variables into numerical values, and ensuring consistency in the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the relationships between features like age, class, gender, and survival.
3. **Visualizations**: Creating charts to better understand the patterns in the data, including survival rates by class, sex, and age group.
4. **Conclusions**: Summarizing the key findings from the analysis.
